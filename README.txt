## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

There are a bunch of things I wish to implement to this site.  First of all, I'd like to add some parallax scrolling effects to modernize the feel a bit.  I also want to add more opportunity for interaction with different elements of the site to demonstrate my skill and engage potential clients further.
