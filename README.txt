# My Portfolio
This is a website where you can see some of my recent projects, learn about my background, and get in touch with me.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I had a lot of fun putting this website up!  

## Optimizations

There are a bunch of things I wish to implement to this site.  First of all, I'd like to add some parallax scrolling effects to modernize the feel a bit.  I also want to add more opportunity for interaction with different elements of the site to demonstrate my skill and engage potential clients further.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
